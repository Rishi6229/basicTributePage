                <h2><u>Achievements in World Cricket</u></h2>

                <p>Dhoni scored his first century in his fifth one-day international. He scored 148 in Visakhapatnam off
                    only 123 deliveries. And thus began the Dhoni era.
                    By the 2011 WC, Dhoni was the captain of all three Tests, T20I, and ODI’s. Dhoni’s major
                    contribution with the bat came in the finals against Sri Lanka. Chasing 275 at the Wankhede, Dhoni
                    promoted himself up the order after Sachin, Sehwag, and Virat Kohli lost their wickets early.
                    Dhoni’s crucial decision to promote himself up the order to put off Muralitharan’s spin threat and
                    right hand-left hand combo showed why he was one of India’s best captains.
                    Under Dhoni’s captaincy in the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, the Men in Blue
                    were able to reach the semi-finals with comfort, beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals
                    India had won 7 consecutive matches in this World Cup and won 11 straight games overall in World
                    Cups. After beating Bangladesh, MSD became the first non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches,
                    and the first Indian captain to hold the record.

                <h2>What he left behind ?</h2>
                <p>
                    He has further enhanced the legacy of Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble and Rahul Dravid along with
                    creating his own legacy.
                    He is a captain par excellence and a cricket intellectual.
                    His legacy is best reflected in the mindset of current captain Virat Kohli.
                    In batting, he was one of the pioneers of “staying till the end” strategy, I.e. taking singles and
                    doubles with occasional boundaries with quick running between the wickets.
                    In captaincy his approach was “quiet in words, but aggressive in performance”.
                    The previous captains' had improved India's performance in tests including overseas series, while
                    Dhoni had won many finals and tournaments including all ICC majors.
                    Hence, his approach, cool nature and brave decisions are something that shall serve as a legacy for
                    future cricket leaders. And also his hard-working will be an inspiration for all budding cricketers.
